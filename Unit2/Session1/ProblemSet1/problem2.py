# Write a function create_dictionary() that takes in a list of keys and a list of values as parameters. The function returns a dictionary where each item in keys is paired with a corresponding item in values.

# keys[i] should be paired with values[i] in the dictionary where 0 <= i <= len(keys). You may assume keys and values are the same length.

def create_dictionary(keys, values):
    pass
