# Write a function restock_inventory() that updates an inventory dictionary based on a restock list. It accepts two parameters:

#     current_inventory: a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an item and its current stock in the inventory
#     restock_list: a dictionary where each key-value pair represents an item and the quantity to be added to the inventory

# If an item in restock_list is not present in the current_inventory, it should be added. The function should return the updated dictionary current_inventory.

def restock_inventory(current_inventory, restock_list):
    pass
