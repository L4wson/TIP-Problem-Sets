# Write a function print_pair() that takes in a dictionary dictionary and a key target as parameters. The function looks for the target and when found, it prints the key and it's associated value as "Key: <key>" followed by "Value: <value>". If target is not in dictionary, print "That pair does not exist!".

def print_pair(dictionary, target):
    pass
